# Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the Sales Dashboard application to various platforms, with a focus on Vercel.

## Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the optimal deployment platform for Next.js applications. Follow these steps to deploy your application:

### Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account
2. A Vercel account (free available at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Push your local code to the repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Sign in to your Vercel account
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework

3. **Configure Project**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: ./
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

4. **Environment Variables**
   - No environment variables are required for this application

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Your application will be live within minutes!

### Vercel Project Settings

When deploying to Vercel, use these settings:
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Development Command: `npm run dev`
- Install Command: `npm install`
- Output Directory: `.next`

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Netlify
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Sign in to Netlify
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next/standalone` (if using standalone output)
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Docker Deployment
A Dockerfile is provided for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t sales-dashboard .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 sales-dashboard
```

## Environment Variables

This application does not require any environment variables for basic functionality. All data is currently mock data.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
If you encounter build issues:
1. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. Check that Node.js version is 18.17 or later
3. Verify that the build command is `npm run build`

### Runtime Issues
If the deployed application doesn't work as expected:
1. Check the Vercel logs for error messages
2. Ensure all required files are included in the build
3. Verify that the output directory is correctly set

## Performance Optimization

### Vercel Optimizations
Vercel automatically optimizes Next.js applications with:
- Automatic static optimization
- Serverless function optimization
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS

### Custom Optimizations
To further optimize performance:
1. Implement image optimization using Next.js Image component
2. Use dynamic imports for large components
3. Implement code splitting
4. Use SWR or React Query for data fetching

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Vercel Analytics
Vercel provides built-in analytics for:
- Page views
- Performance metrics
- Visitor geography
- Device information

### Custom Analytics
To add custom analytics:
1. Integrate Google Analytics
2. Add error tracking with Sentry
3. Implement performance monitoring

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment to Vercel. To use it:

1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel token
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

2. The workflow will automatically deploy on pushes to the main branch

## Scaling Considerations

### Vercel Scaling
Vercel automatically handles scaling for:
- Traffic spikes
- Global distribution
- Serverless function scaling

### Custom Scaling
For high-traffic applications:
1. Implement caching strategies
2. Use a CDN for static assets
3. Optimize database queries
4. Implement load balancing

## Security Considerations

### Vercel Security
Vercel provides:
- Automatic HTTPS
- DDoS protection
- Secure headers
- Regular security updates

### Additional Security Measures
1. Implement proper authentication
2. Sanitize user inputs
3. Use environment variables for secrets
4. Regularly update dependencies
